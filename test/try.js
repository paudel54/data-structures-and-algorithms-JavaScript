// OK. Good. Here's a tutorial on Flutter that we use in our lab all the time. It's the official one.  https://docs.flutter.dev/

// To be able to understand and contribute to the project you should have covered the "User interface" and "Beyond UI" sections. Do as much as you can in the next two weeks and join us on Feb 16 (Friday) at 1pm EST. You don't have to finish the tutorial by then. However, you should hopefully know enough by then so that the work being discussed would make sense to you.

// As for the app. Here's the Amazon app store link for it. https://www.amazon.com/Disabled-Persons-Protection-Commission-Recognize/dp/B0C6VG4YNC/

// The app is NOT available on the Google PlayStore. Remember, the app is not for children. You have to be over 18 years of age to download and use it.

// Thanks
